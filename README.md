# 🤖 100 Days of Agentic AI Challenge

**Welcome to the ultimate journey into the world of Autonomous AI Agents!**

This repository documents my journey to build, test, and refine **100 consecutive AI agents**. The goal is to explore the capabilities of LLMs, agentic workflows, and intelligent automation—releasing a new agent **every 2 days**.

## 🌟 The Challenge

The **100 Days of Agentic AI** is a rigorous coding marathon where I solve a new problem using AI agents.
- **Goal**: Build 100 unique, functional AI agents.
- **Focus**: Real-world utility, automation, and advanced reasoning.
- **Consistency**: One agent, every 2 days.

## � Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days. Each folder (e.g., `01`, `02`) represents a single day's challenge and contains:
- **`README.md`**: Explanation of the specific agent, its logic, and setup instructions.
- **`agent.py`**: The core source code for the agent.
- **Supporting Files**: Any inputs, datasets, or config files required for that specific agent.

To see how to run a specific agent, please navigate to its corresponding folder.
