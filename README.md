# 🤖 100 Days of Agentic AI Challenge

**Welcome to the ultimate journey into the world of Autonomous AI Agents!**

This repository documents my journey to build, test, and refine **100 consecutive AI agents**. The goal is to explore the capabilities of LLMs, agentic workflows, and intelligent automation—releasing a new agent **every 2 days**.

## 🌟 The Challenge

The **100 Days of Agentic AI** is a rigorous coding marathon where I solve a new problem using AI agents.
- **Goal**: Build 100 unique, functional AI agents.
- **Focus**: Real-world utility, automation, and advanced reasoning.
- **Consistency**: One agent, every 2 days.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is designed as a **Learning Course**. Each folder (e.g., `01`, `02`) contains a self-contained Agentic AI challenge.

- **`TASK.md`**: The **Challenge Instructions**. Start here! It explains the goal and requirements.
- **`SOLUTION.md`**: The **Whiteboard/Logic**. Read this to understand the reasoning, prompt design, and architecture behind the solution.
- **`reference_solution.py`**: The **Code**. A complete, working implementation of the agent.

## 🛠️ Setup (The Modern Way with `uv`)

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for lightning-fast Python management.

1.  **Install uv** (if you haven't):
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Environment**:
    - **Windows**:
      ```powershell
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **Mac/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the specific day's folder and install libraries:
    ```bash
    uv pip install openai python-dotenv
    ```

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1.  **Pick a Day**: Go to a folder (e.g., `cd 01`).
2.  **Read the Task**: Check `TASK.md` to see what you need to build.
3.  **Build It**: Try to implement the agent yourself first!
4.  **Get Help**: If you get stuck, check `SOLUTION.md` or run `reference_solution.py`.
